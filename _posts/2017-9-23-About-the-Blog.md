title: About this Blog
---

There's not much to this blog. But there is on my *real* blogs:

- [Everything is Sheep](https://everything-is-sheep.herokuapp.com) (2017-)
- [The Homework Life](http://www.thehomeworklife.co.nf) (2015-16)

The best part of this site is actually under the About page. These are demos of all of the web projects I've created that are stored under GitHub. To see the code, check out [my Github](https://www.github.com/jlam55555). To see other small coding snippets and projects, check out [my JSFiddle](http://www.jsfiddle.net/user/jlam55555).
