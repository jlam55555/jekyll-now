This is the story of a boy.

For a long time, he wanted to be a "car engineer." He loved playing with his model cars and could list two dozen car brands. But when he reached around 10 years old, and his friends were using big words like "carbuerator" or "differential," he realized how little he actually knew.

When he was eleven, his mother bought two old books from the used book sale. One was about Java; the other HTML. She thought they might be interesting for the boy.
